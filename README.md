# vim-sessions

Plugin to help manage vim sessions. You can save sessions using `:SessionSave {name}` and restore sessions by using `:SessionRestore {name}`. Mappings exist for all letters similar to registers. Save a session with `<Leader>ss{key}` and restore a session with `<Leader>sr{key}`. There is also a jumplist that saves recent sessions you have used. You can jump backwards with `:SessionTravel` or `<Leader>so`.
